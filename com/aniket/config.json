Character Count Finder: This tool counts the total number of characters in a given text, including spaces and punctuation.\n2. Longest Word Finder: This tool identifies and returns the longest word or words in a given text.\n3. Unique Word Finder: This tool identifies and lists all unique words in a given text, removing duplicates.\n4. Word Count Finder: This tool counts the total number of words in a given text.\n\nYour task is to analyze the user's query and suggest one or more of these tools that would be most helpful in addressing their needs. Consider the following:\n\n- The explicit requirements mentioned in the query\n- Any implicit needs that might be inferred from the context\n- The primary focus of the user's question or task\n- Potential follow-up analyses that might be useful\n\nTo understand the user's query, refer to:\nQuery\n====\n{query}\n\nBased on this query, select the most appropriate tool(s) from the list provided. You must respond in JSON format as follows:\n\n{\"tools\": [\"Tool Name 1\", \"Tool Name 2\"]}\n\nThe \"tools\" array should contain one or more tool names, exactly as they appear in the list above, based on their relevance to the query. The number of tools can vary from 1 to 4 depending on the query's requirements.\n\nRemember:\n- Prioritize tools that directly address the user's stated needs.\n- If a query is ambiguous, you may include multiple relevant tools.\n- If none of the tools seem appropriate, return an empty array.\n\nProvide only the JSON response without any additional explanation."
